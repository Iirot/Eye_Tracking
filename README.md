Tasks:

1 - Load the raw data for the subjects assigned to you and perform fixation detection using an algorithm of your choice. You will need to output the duration of each fixation for further processing, and you may beed a centroid point x,y. Try two distinct settings for your algorithm and compare.

2 - Report for your data the following analyses: for each subject, a mean fixation durations (MFD) and mean saccade amplitudes (MSA) for the known=true and for known=false (four values in total). For all subjects aggregated mean fixation duration for known true and false (two values). Include standard deviation (SD) for all measures.

A mean fixation duration is the sum of durations of all fixations belonging to one condition divided by the number of fixations from this condition, e.g. all fixations that belong to one subject and to one setting (e.g. known = true, or known=false, or all data).

3 - Create a csv file with the following structure, named according to your group, and fill in the resulting data:

subject_id   MFD_true MFD_SD_true MFD_false MFD_SD_false MSA_true MSA_SD_true MSA_false MSA_SD_false MFD_overall MFD_overall_SD MSA_overall MSA_overall_SD

... ... ... ... ... ...

... ... ... ... ... ...

4 - Create plots from the data, using SPSS, Excel, R, Matlab, or a tool of your choice. Use charts so that you can indicate standard deviation or standard error of the mean as +-error bars. Important: compare the known=true and known=false conditions (for aggregated data), and discuss eventual differences briefly. You may add other visualizations, for example a scatter plot of MSA x MFD. The goal is to show insights into the data.

5 - Write a report detailing all steps, including the settings of your algorithm, source code of the data processing script, not exceeding 4 pages (not counting figures). Include the output csv file to the submission.

 Important: List the group members, and indicate their contribution out of the total 100%.

Create a zip file and submit it using the Assignment.
